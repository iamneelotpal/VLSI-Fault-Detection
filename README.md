# VLSI-Fault-Detection

## Abstract
Physical Failure Analysis (PFA) is an important process that identifies layout designs contributing to failures in Large-Scale Integration (LSI) circuits. Due to their efficiency and cost effectiveness, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing LSI layouts. However, the application of CNNs to root cause analysis faces significant challenges. Information on failures is often sparse, and understanding the impact of layout deigns on defects needs information from large regions having a multitude of geometries. These factors are sources of hindrance in successful training of CNN models with high accuracy in layout segment classification.<br />
This report presents a CNN-based algorithm for layout segment classification. This is an attempt to know the way layouts contribute to failure. The proposed approach relies on the use of several segment images of LSI layouts as inputs to the CNN models for segment classification as either ”risk” or ”non-risk.” Two CNN architectures were tested in this study: a simple 3-layer model and a more complex 9-layer model. The 9-layer model, with its depth and better feature extraction ability, was much better than the simple model at classifying LSI layout segments. With thorough cross-validation, the 9-layer model reached an accuracy of 99%. This shows the promise of deep learning techniques in improving layout designs and reducing failure risks in the manufacturing process of LSI circuits.
